# Grid Component Refactoring Plan

## Current Structure Analysis

The current `Grid.js` file (517 lines) combines several distinct responsibilities:
- Canvas management and context handling
- Coordinate calculations and transformations
- State management for axes
- Event handling (via this.emit())
- Origin pinning and positioning logic
- Rendering and drawing operations

## Previous Refactoring Attempt

A previous refactoring approach (`failed-attempts/split-grid-01`) attempted to split the Grid into:
- **GridCalculator**: Handling coordinate math, state calculation, and axes management
- **GridRenderer**: Focused on drawing operations and canvas management

While this separation of concerns was fundamentally sound, it appears to have had integration challenges.

## Refactoring Strategy

Based on the context document's goals to "maintain Grid as a pure calculation and rendering engine without Fabric.js dependencies", here's our proposed approach:

### 1. Separate Concerns More Clearly
- Create a more effective separation between calculation and rendering
- Implement a standardized component architecture pattern
- Ensure interfaces between components are well-defined

### 2. Implement Pure Functions
- Move coordinate calculations to pure, stateless functions where possible
- Reduce reliance on instance state for calculations
- Create utility functions for complex math operations

### 3. Improve State Management
- Define a clear state container pattern
- Make state changes explicit and traceable
- Consider using immutable state patterns where appropriate

### 4. Simplify Event Handling
- Streamline the event system
- Standardize event naming and propagation
- Ensure events are only emitted when necessary

### 5. Cleaner Interfaces
- Create well-defined contracts between modules
- Establish clear responsibilities for each component
- Document interfaces thoroughly

### 6. Implementation Phases
1. Create utility functions for coordinate math
2. Implement core state management
3. Build rendering system with clear interfaces
4. Connect components with minimal coupling
5. Add comprehensive tests to ensure functionality is preserved

## Goals Alignment

This refactoring will ensure we:
- Maintain Grid as a pure calculation and rendering engine
- Keep it free from Fabric.js dependencies
- Preserve existing functionality while improving maintainability
- Keep Grid focused on coordinate mathematics, line drawing, and axis management
- Avoid coupling to specific canvas implementations or rendering frameworks
