# Grid Object - Current State and Goals

## Current State (100 words)

The Grid class is a standalone canvas-based grid rendering system that handles coordinate calculations, line drawing, axis management, and label positioning. It accepts an HTML canvas element in its constructor and manages its own 2D rendering context. The Grid performs coordinate transformations, zoom calculations, and viewport management independently. It includes features like origin pinning, axis labeling, tick marks, and grid line styling. The class assumes full ownership of its canvas, including clearing operations and dimension management. Grid integrates with Axis objects for coordinate system calculations and supports both X and Y axis rendering with customizable styling, colors, and positioning options.

## Goals (50 words)

Maintain Grid as a pure calculation and rendering engine without Fabric.js dependencies. Preserve existing functionality while remaining compatible with context swapping integration patterns. Keep Grid focused on coordinate mathematics, line drawing, and axis management without coupling to specific canvas implementations or rendering frameworks.
