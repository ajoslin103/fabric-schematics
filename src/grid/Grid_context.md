# Grid Object - Current State and Goals

## Current State (200 words)
The Grid class is a sophisticated canvas-based rendering system that manages coordinate calculations, line drawing, axis management, and label positioning. It accepts an HTML canvas element in its constructor and maintains complete control over the 2D rendering context. The Grid implements a comprehensive event system (this.emit()) for notifying state changes including origin pin adjustments, zoom changes, and updates. Core functionality revolves around coordinate transformation methods ( calcCoordinate , getCoords , getRatio ) that handle complex viewport mathematics and zoom calculations. Grid maintains internal state objects for both X and Y axes, with each axis aware of its counterpart through cross-references (state.opposite). The class features origin pinning ( setOriginPin , setPinMargin ) which can lock grid corners to specific positions during transformations, crucial for maintaining spatial references during zoom operations. The rendering pipeline consists of discrete stages: update methods recalculate coordinate states, draw orchestrates the rendering sequence, while specialized methods ( drawLines , drawLabels ) handle specific rendering tasks. Grid integrates with Axis objects for coordinate system calculations with support for both linear and custom mappings. Styling is managed through a combination of internal defaults and configurable parameters, controlling grid line appearance, tick marks, and label formatting. The update2 method handles center point translations and zoom level changes, providing viewport management while maintaining coordinate integrity during transformations. All drawing operations render directly to the canvas context with no intermediary buffer.


## Goals (50 words)

Maintain Grid as a pure calculation and rendering engine without Fabric.js dependencies. Preserve existing functionality while remaining compatible with context swapping integration patterns. Keep Grid focused on coordinate mathematics, line drawing, and axis management without coupling to specific canvas implementations or rendering frameworks.
