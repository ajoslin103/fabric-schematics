Implementation Plan for Fabric-Layers-Core Grid Integration
Overview
This plan outlines the steps to refactor the fabric-layers-core grid implementation, integrating it properly within the fabric.js canvas hierarchy instead of using a separate canvas element. The plan is designed for execution with Claude-Sonnet 3.5 and includes strategic pause points for code commits.

Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis
Step 1: Examine Current Implementation
Analyze how the grid is currently implemented
Identify the key files involved in grid rendering
Understand how the Map class initializes and manages the grid
Document the current API surface for grid interactions
Step 2: Prototype Grid as Fabric.js Objects
Research optimal fabric.js objects for grid lines (likely fabric.Line)
Determine performance considerations for large numbers of lines
Consider grouping strategies for efficient management
PAUSE FOR USER REVIEW AND COMMIT

Phase 2: Core Implementation
Step 3: Create Grid Object Model
Implement a new GridLayer class extending from fabric.Group
Design efficient line creation and updating mechanisms
Ensure proper z-indexing to keep grid behind other elements
Implement grid styling options
Step 4: Update Map Class Integration
Modify Map class to use the new grid implementation
Remove references to separate grid canvas
Ensure proper initialization sequence
Update grid visibility toggle functionality
PAUSE FOR USER REVIEW AND COMMIT

Phase 3: Performance Optimization
Step 5: Optimize Rendering Performance
Implement view-dependent line density
Add culling for off-screen grid elements
Consider caching strategies for stable views
Optimize pan/zoom operations
Step 6: Event Handling
Ensure events propagate correctly through grid layer
Fix any interaction issues with objects above grid
Update event documentation
PAUSE FOR USER REVIEW AND COMMIT

Phase 4: API Compatibility and Testing
Step 7: Ensure API Compatibility
Create compatibility layer for deprecated methods
Update public API documentation
Ensure all grid customization options still work
Step 8: Update Demos and Tests
Fix grid-demo.html and other examples
Update tests to reflect new implementation
Create visual regression tests to verify rendering
PAUSE FOR USER REVIEW AND COMMIT

Phase 5: Cleanup and Documentation
Step 9: Code Cleanup
Remove deprecated grid canvas code
Clean up any temporary compatibility code
Ensure proper TypeScript definitions
Step 10: Documentation Updates
Update README and API documentation
Create migration guide for users
Document performance considerations
PAUSE FOR USER REVIEW AND FINAL COMMIT

Implementation Details for Claude-Sonnet 3.5
When implementing this plan, please follow these guidelines:

Always examine the full context of files before making changes
Begin each step with clear comments explaining the purpose of the changes
Keep changes focused on the specific task at hand
Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout
Add detailed JSDoc comments for any new or modified functions
When you encounter an issue that requires making architectural decisions, ask the user for input
After each phase, summarize what was accomplished and what remains to be done
Remember to pause at the indicated points and inform the user that you've completed a phase and are ready for review and commit before proceeding to the next phase.
