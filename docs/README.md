# Fabric Layers Core Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the `fabric-layers-core` library, a JavaScript library built on top of fabric.js that provides a powerful system for creating interactive, canvas-based maps with support for layers, grids, measurements, and drawing tools.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized to parallel the source code structure, with dedicated files for each module in the library. This makes it easy to find information about specific components and understand how they fit into the overall architecture.

## Getting Started

If you're new to fabric-layers-core, we recommend starting with these documents:

1. [Conceptual Guide](conceptual-guide.md) - Mental models and thinking patterns for using the library
2. [Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md) - High-level understanding of the library's structure
3. [Using Layers](using-layers.md) - Practical guide to adding and working with layers
4. [Understanding Layers](understanding-layers.md) - Deeper dive into the layer architecture

## Core Concepts

* [Groups vs Layers](groups-vs-layers.md) - Comparing two approaches to managing composite objects

## Module Documentation

### Core Components

* [Core Module](core-module.md) - Base classes and constants
* [Geometry Module](geometry-module.md) - Point class and geometric operations
* [Map Module](map-module.md) - Central canvas management and integration

### Layer System

* [Layer Module](layer-module.md) - Layer system overview
  * [Layer Marker Module](layer-marker-module.md) - Point-based markers
  * [Layer Vector Module](layer-vector-module.md) - Vector shapes (lines, polygons)

### Specialized Modules

* [Grid Module](grid-module.md) - Coordinate grid system
* [Measurement Module](measurement-module.md) - Distance and area measurements
* [Paint Module](paint-module.md) - Drawing and annotation tools
